## Getting Started

Welcome to [Fractal](https://frac.gg)! 

### 1. Sign into the dashboard

Head to [frac.gg](https://frac.gg) and sign into the dashboard with your email and password.

If you haven't created an account yet, click **Create an Account** and follow the instructions.

### 2. Create a server

Click **Create Server** and select the game you'd like to play. You can also select the region you'd like the server to be in, alongside the resources (CPU, RAM, Storage) you'd like the server to have. By default, you'll get 4GB RAM, 1.5 CPU cores and 30GB of storage.

### 3. Use the Panel

Unlike other hosts, our panel is built into the dashboard. Once your server is created, you can find it in the **Servers** tab. You can then use the panel to manage your server, view the console, edit files and more.
