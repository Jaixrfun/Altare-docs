Updating your server software (Paper, Spigot, Forge, etc) is a very simple process. There are two ways to go about this.

## Manual update

1. Download the latest version of the server software you are using from their
   respective websites:
   - [PaperMC](https://papermc.io/downloads)
   - [Spigot](https://spigotmc.org/wiki/buildtools)
   - [Forge](https://files.minecraftforge.net/)
2. Stop your server and create a backup, just in case the update fails.
3. Delete the old server software JAR file (usually named `server.jar`,
   double-check your startup command to make sure).
4. Place the new JAR file in the same directory as the old one. Ensure the name
   of the JAR is the same, if it has changed, make sure the startup command
   reflects the change.
5. Start your server, and run `/version` or `/about` to ensure the server is
   running the new version.

## Automatic update (via Fractal's Heliactyl panel)

1. Stop your server.
2. Create a backup, just in case the update fails. You can do this by clicking
   the "**Create Backup**" button in the Backups tab.
3. Head to the **Advanced** tab and ensure the `MINECRAFT_VERSION` is set to `latest`.
4. Click the **Reinstall** button on the **Settings** page. This button overwrites the `server.jar` file
   with the latest version of the server software you are using.
5. Start your server, and run `/version` or `/about` to ensure the server is
   running the new version.
