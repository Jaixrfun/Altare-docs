## Getting Started

Welcome to [Altare](https://altare.pro/app)! 

### 1. Sign into the console

Head to [Console](https://console.altare.pro/app/auth) and sign into the console using our discord Oauth2.

### 2. Create a server

<Warning>**We only support Minecraft for now.**</Warning>

Click **New Server** and select the minecraft software you'd like to want. You can also select the region you'd like the server to be in, alongside the resources (CPU, RAM, Storage) you'd like the server to have. By default, you'll get 4GB RAM, 1.5 CPU cores and 10GB of storage.

### 3. Use the Panel

Unlike other hosts, our panel is built into the dashboard. Once your server is created, you can find it in the **Servers** tab. You can then use the panel to manage your server, view the console, edit files and more.
